## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Backend Developer focused on building scalable and efficient systems using modern technologies. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean architecture and reliable backend services that power seamless user experiences.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building event-driven backend services using Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis, and MySQL
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kafka stream processing, system design principles, and preparing to dive into networking and cybersecurity
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  Java | Spring Boot
  Redis | Kafka | MySQL
  REST APIs & backend optimization
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love exploring how things work under the hood â€” whether itâ€™s code, networks, or systems!
